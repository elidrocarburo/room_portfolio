## 🍭 About

A 3D Room built with Three.js, featuring a 3D model made with Blender, to create an atractive portfolio for the user.

## ❗ Main Features

- 🎀 **3D Room Model**: The user can interact with a 3D Model and change the view of the camera (zoom, rotate, move).
- 🎀 **Background music**: The website plays a background music if the user interacts with the scenario.

## 🍨 About Blender and Three.js

- 🎀 **Blender**: Free and open-source 3D creation suite used for modeling. For this project I made the models with many techniques, such as:
    - Extrude
    - Bevel
    - Inset
    - Loop cut
    - Use of modifiers
    - Playing with the faces, edges and vertices of the objects
- 🎀 **Three.js**:
